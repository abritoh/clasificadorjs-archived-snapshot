# ClasificadorJS - Custom License

## License Summary

This tool, **ClasificadorJS**, is an AngularJS front-end application originally developed between 2015 and 2016 to assist law enforcement agencies in Mexico, specifically the former Federal Police (now dissolved). It is a modular, extensible, and component-oriented AngularJS application designed to aid in operational, classification, and investigation tasks. 

The software was created as a foundational base for other projects and includes reusable structures, AngularJS coding patterns, templates, controllers, and components that were meant to be utilized across multiple applications. 

This version of the project is a **draft version**, with the aim to provide visibility of the author's work and to offer guidance on AngularJS front-end development practices.
